# Welcome to Front X
This is a base of a small project that helps Frontend developers to upgrade their hard skills in: `Vue.js`, `JavaScript`, `HTML5` and `CSS3` in beginning but we can introduce anything that we want to learn or practice like `Unit Tests` or `Storybook` (this is an amazing tool to go better your job!).

## Project setup
We are using `Vue.js 3`, so if you wanna check out the docs or learn more about it go to [**Introduction to Vue.js 3**](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html). We recommend that you use the Composition API on this job because is a different way to organize your files and start something new (if you aren't doing it yet ^^).
```
npm install
```

## Including Jest (Unit test)
Unit tests are a very important step to make your job almost indestructible! With some files `name.test.js` we can test if our validations, APIs, if the components exist, and so much more to help us get errors before starting in production. You can also see this doc [**Include Jest on Already Created Project**](https://cli.vuejs.org/core-plugins/unit-jest.html#installing-in-an-already-created-project).
```
vue add unit-jest
```

## Including Storybook
If you care about documentation and UI visual elements with a beautiful composition and completed testable, like a button with primary, secondary types, and different sizes. Imagine wonderful documentation with interactive controls to test how your component adapts when changing the color, text, or those props? Can you imagine that? Well, this is a Storybook try now! [**The docs**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/install).
```
# Add Storybook:
npx sb init

# Starts Storybook in development mode
npm run storybook
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
